Transportation on vacation

DESCRIPTION:
After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.
You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.
Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.
Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

SOLUTION:
function rentalCarCost(d) {
  // Your solution here
   let CostPerDay = 40;
  var CarCost = CostPerDay*d;
  
   
  if (d >= 7) {CarCost = CarCost - 50} 
  else if (d >= 3) {CarCost = CarCost -20} 
  
  return CarCost
}
